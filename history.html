                        <p style="font-family: mv boli;">Liverpool F.C. was founded following a dispute between the Everton committee and John Houlding, club president and owner of the land at Anfield. After eight years at the stadium, Everton relocated to Goodison Park in 1892 and Houlding founded Liverpool F.C. to play at Anfield. Originally named "Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd" (Everton Athletic for short), the club became Liverpool F.C. in March 1892 and gained official recognition three months later, after The Football Association refused to recognise the club as Everton. The team won the Lancashire League in its debut season, and joined the Football League Second Division at the start of the 1893–94 season. After finishing in first place the club was promoted to the First Division, which it won in 1901 and again in 1906.</p>

              <div class="row">

                    <br>
                  <p style="font-family: mv boli;">In the early 60s, Bill Shankly was appointed manager. The composition of the team was seriously updated - 24 new players arrived immediately. In addition, he turned the Anfield facility, originally used as a pantry, into a room where coaches could discuss tactics over tea (or other drinks). There, Shankly, as well as other founders of the Boot Room, Joe Fagan, Robin Bennett and Bob Paisley began the restructuring of the team.
                    Return to the First Division was achieved in the 1961/62 season, then the club won the League for the first time in 17 years in the 1963/64 season. Then in 1966 Liverpool won the 7th championship of England, and a year earlier, having won extra time against Leeds United, the Reds won their first FA Cup.
                    Paisley was even more successful. Under Paisley, Liverpool held 490 official matches, in which they won 275 victories, 91 games reduced to a draw and suffered 124 defeats. During this time, the club has won 19 major tournaments, including six league titles. Bob Paisley is one of two coaches in the world who won the Champions League three times, having achieved this with one club - in 1977, 1978 and 1981.

                          <p style="font-family: mv boli;">In 85's Kenny Dalglish was appointed as player-manager. During his tenure, the club won another three league titles and two FA Cups, including a League and Cup "Double" in the 1985–86 season. Liverpool's success was overshadowed by the Hillsborough disaster: in an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989, hundreds of Liverpool fans were crushed against perimeter fencing.Ninety-four fans died that day; the 95th victim died in hospital from his injuries four days later and the 96th died nearly four years later, without regaining consciousness. After the Hillsborough disaster there was a government review of stadium safety. The resulting Taylor Report paved the way for legislation that required top-division teams to have all-seater stadiums. The report ruled that the main reason for the disaster was overcrowding due to a failure of police control.

                            Liverpool was involved in the closest finish to a league season during the 1988–89 season. Liverpool finished equal with Arsenal on both points and goal difference, but lost the title on total goals scored when Arsenal scored the final goal in the last minute of the season.

                            Liverpool was involved in the closest finish to a league season during the 1988–89 season. Liverpool finished equal with Arsenal on both points and goal difference, but lost the title on total goals scored when Arsenal scored the final goal in the last minute of the season.
                            Despite finishing fifth in Benítez's first season, Liverpool won the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League, beating A.C. Milan 3–2 in a penalty shootout after the match ended with a score of 3–3. The following season, Liverpool finished third in the Premier League and won the 2006 FA Cup Final, beating West Ham United in a penalty shootout after the match finished 3–3.  In the 2011–12 season, Liverpool secured a record 8th League Cup success and reached the FA Cup final, but finished in eighth position, the worst league finish in 18 years; this led to the sacking of Dalglish. He was replaced by Brendan Rodgers, whose Liverpool team in the 2013–14 season mounted an unexpected title charge to finish second behind champions Manchester City and subsequently return to the Champions League, scoring 101 goals in the process, the most since the 106 scored in the 1895–96 season.Following a disappointing 2014–15 season, where Liverpool finished sixth in the league, and a poor start to the following campaign, Rodgers was sacked in October 2015.
                            Rodgers was replaced by Jürgen Klopp.In his first season at Liverpool, he took the club to the finals of the Football League Cup and UEFA Europa League, finishing as runner-up in both competitions.Liverpool finished second in the 2018–19 season with 97 points, losing only one game: a points record for a non-title winning side. Klopp took Liverpool to successive Champions League Finals in 2018 and 2019, with the club defeating Tottenham Hotspur 2–0 to win the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final.In December 2019, the club won the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time, defeating Brazilian club Flamengo in the final.
